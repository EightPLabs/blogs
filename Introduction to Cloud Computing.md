# Introduction to Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is a revolutionary tech in the modern age of technological advancements. The functionalities of cloud computing have adapted in various fields and domains starting from web development to healthcare sectors to store, secure, and manage their data without the involvement of any physical servers.

In this blog, let us explore what cloud computing is, why it is better than the old traditional methods, and its application and use cases in real-time.

## Cloud Computing Overview

Ever thought about how OTT platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime manage to store and stream countless movies and TV shows simultaneously without any problem,? On a physical server, it is impossible to store all those movies and TV shows due to the very fact that many users cannot access common content simultaneously and maintenance costs will be high.

To overcome these situations and to make a smooth movie-watching experience OTT platforms adopt cloud computing to run their applications. Rather than using local hard drives and private data centers, cloud computing offers remote servers that can store and retrieve information.

Now let's see what clouds are. The cloud is simply a virtual space where you can store your data, host applications, and provide content or services over the internet.

### Applications of Cloud Computing in Real-time

We utilize cloud computing technologies in our everyday routines more frequently than we might realize.

**Social media platforms:** The major social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp use cloud services for social networking. Cloud also provides security mechanisms for social media platforms to store sensible user data to protect from unauthorized third parties.

**Online Shopping:** Online shopping platforms store their products and secure their customer's online transactions with the help of the cloud.

Movie and music streaming platforms, File hosting services like Google Drive, and chatbots are some real-world applications of the cloud.

## Challenges of On-premise Models

On-premise models are the traditional methods of storing data in physical servers and data centers. Although these models were usable in real time, they faced various challenges in providing secure and scalable data storage services to users. The main limitation of the On-premise models was that they did not have a disaster recovery mechanism. Once data is lost in this model it is permanently lost and cannot be recovered at any cost.

The On-premise models have limited storage capacity and the extension of the capacities causes a lot of power supply and manpower.

The maintenance cost of the physical servers is high and the software and hardware components have to be constantly updated manually to stay updated.

## How does Cloud Computing Address It?

Cloud computing addresses the limitations of the on-premise model by offering enhanced disaster recovery mechanisms, and scalable storage solutions without physical limitations. Cloud computing allows users to retrieve data and run applications from anywhere with an internet connection. Users of cloud services can pay for resources only when needed and get more space easily since the providers offer their services on pays-per-use terms.

Cloud computing overcomes all the limitations of the on-premise model by providing flexible and cost-effective alternative services. Cloud services providers take on the responsibility of infrastructure management, promoting scalability, and offering robust security measures

## Models of Cloud Computing

The cloud computing model has been categorized into the following types

**1. Infrastructure as a Service**

It provides virtualized computing resources like computers, storage, and internet connections. IaaS lets companies adjust the amount of resources they use based on their needs, which is helpful when workloads change.

Example: Amazon Web Services

**2. Platform as a Service**

It offers a platform that helps developers build and manage applications without dealing with complicated technical details. PaaS makes it easier for developers to create and launch applications by providing a ready-made environment.

Example: Google App Engine

**3. Software as a Service**

It shares software applications online, removing the requirement for users to install, handle, or update the software on their devices. SaaS applications are compatible with different devices, offering users the convenience to access and collaborate from anywhere.

Example: Gmail

**4. Serverless Model**

The cloud service provider is responsible for scaling the application. You can pay for server capacity in an on-demand fashion.

Example: AWS Serverless

## Where Cloud Computing is a Great Fit?

Cloud computing suits various scenarios, some of which are

**Scalability:** The organizations can make necessary changes in the volume of resource usage as per their needs.

**Collaboration:** Cloud services simplify teamwork as their data and applications can be accessed from various places connected to the internet.

**Cost Efficiency** : The pay-as-you-go model means companies only pay for what they use. This reduces upfront costs and makes cloud computing a cost-effective choice for managing IT business,

## When Cloud Computing is Not a Great Fit

While cloud computing offers multiple advantages, it may not be a good fit for every scenario.

**Data Sensitivity:** Industries with strict rules about keeping information private might choose to keep their data on-premise. This way, they have more control over who can access their data.

**Unstable Internet Connectivity:** In places where the internet isn't always reliable, using cloud services might cause problems.

**Legacy Systems Integration:** Some businesses heavily reliant on legacy systems may find it challenging to seamlessly integrate them with cloud services, requiring substantial modifications.

## Summary of Pros and Cons:

In conclusion, cloud computing has become a potent revolutionary force that enables various companies to optimize their effectiveness through improved efficiencies

**Pros:**

- Cost Efficiency
- Scalability and Flexibility
- Accessibility and Collaboration
- Rapid Innovation

**Cons:**

- Data Sensitivity Concerns
- Legacy System Integration Challenges
- Dependence on Internet Connectivity
