In this blog, let us understand EBS and also explore the AWS console for creating and managing EBS volumes and screenshots.


# EBS Volume



* Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides scalable block-level storage volumes that can be attached to Amazon EC2 instances. These volumes offer flexibility in terms of size, performance, and configuration options to meet the specific needs of applications.
* EBS volumes deliver consistent and low-latency performance, making them suitable for various workloads like transactional databases, high-performance computing, and I/O-intensive applications.
* These volumes serve as raw, unformatted block devices that can be attached to EC2 instances.
* They are replicated within their Availability Zone (AZ) to ensure data durability and availability. Additionally, snapshots can be created to back up EBS volumes that provide point-in-time recovery and disaster recovery capabilities.


## Prerequisites:

These are the prerequisites for creating EBS volume and snapshots in the AWS console



* Sign in to the AWS Console to access EC2 resources.
* Choose a region. For this tutorial, we are choosing the Mumbai region.

##### **General Purpose SSD (gp2)**



* It provides baseline performance with burst capabilities, ideal for general-purpose applications and boot volumes that require consistent performance at a lower cost.


##### **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)**



* It is designed for I/O-intensive applications demanding predictable performance, allowing users to specify desired IOPS and capacity levels.


##### **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2)**



* It offers enhanced durability and consistent performance for critical production workloads, ensuring low-latency and high-throughput storage operations.


##### **Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)**



* Optimized for large, sequential I/O workloads at a low cost, making it suitable for data warehouses, log processing, and analytics.


##### **Cold HDD**



* Designed for infrequent access workloads with large datasets, providing cost-effective storage for scenarios like data archiving and backups.


##### **Magnetic**



* Legacy storage option with low-cost magnetic hard disk drives (HDDs), suitable for low-performance requirements and cost-sensitive applications.

For this tutorial, let us choose **_General purpose SSD (gp3)_**

## Attaching, Detaching, and Deleting EBS Volume



* Attaching and detaching volumes in AWS is essential for managing storage resources efficiently. 
* This process involves associating volumes with EC2 instances to provide additional storage or detaching volumes for maintenance. 
* Efficient execution of these actions ensures smooth operation and optimal resource utilization within the AWS environment.
* When you no longer require your EBS volume delete the resources.


### Attaching the EBS Volume



* Locate the volume you want to attach and select it.
* Click on the **_Actions_** and choose **_Attach Volume_**.


![alt_text](https://github.com/EightPLabs/blogs/blob/main/EBS%20-%20Images/image-013.png?raw=true)




* Select the EC2 instance to which you want to attach the volume.
* Specify the device name (e.g., /dev/sdf) for the attached volume.


![alt_text](https://github.com/EightPLabs/blogs/blob/main/EBS%20-%20Images/image-014.png?raw=true)




* Confirm the attachment and the volume will be accessible from the specified EC2 instance.

### Detaching the EBS Volume



* Locate the volume you want to detach and select it.
* Click on the **_Actions_** on the menu and choose **_Detach Volume_**.
* Confirm the detachment and the volume will be disconnected from the EC2 instance.


### Deleting the EBS Volume



* Locate the volume you want to delete and select it.
* Click on the **_Actions_** and choose **_Delete Volume_**.


![alt_text](https://github.com/EightPLabs/blogs/blob/main/EBS%20-%20Images/image-016.png?raw=true)




* Confirm the deletion and the volume will be permanently removed from your AWS account.

# EBS Snapshots



* EBS snapshots are ideal for data recovery in Amazon EBS volumes.
* Point-in-time recovery allows restoration to specific points in case of data issues.
* Incremental backups record changes since the last snapshot, reducing backup time and storage costs.
* Through snapshot generation, you can provide business resilience and perform disaster recovery as the loss of data of business is prevented.
* EBS snapshots are incremental and reside changes in data concerning the last EBS snapshot. This reduces the time of backing up and reduces the cost of storage.
